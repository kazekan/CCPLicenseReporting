# CCPLicenseReporting
A non-official utility designed to report on CyberArk CCP license consumption

Usage: Upon running the PS script, you will be prompted to select the folder where you would like to report to be placed (which will be created as a "CCPLicenseReport.csv" file. Next, if the AppAudit.log file is not found in the default directory path under either the C: or D: drive, the user will be prompted to select the location of the AppAudit.log file. The AppAudit.log and output file paths will then be written to the console, as well as the unique addresses found and the final count. The CSV report will then be generated for external analysis and potential combination with reports from other CCP servers.

Important notes - PLEASE READ: This script assumes that it will be ran on a CCP server that is NOT also being used as a standalone Credential Provider. Because the script cannot differentiate between CCP calls and direct CP calls, it will be very important to ensure it's only ran on dedicated "CCP servers" for accurate reporting. Once the CSV file is generated, the user will need to manually combine that file with reports from other CCP servers in order to provide a full list of the endpoints and remove any duplicates between them, at least for now. ;)
